## Who's it for?

---------------

Rails Recipes is for people who understand Rails and now want to see how an experienced Rails developer would attack specific problems. Like with a real recipe book, you should be able to flip through the table of contents, find something you need to get done, and get from start to finish in a matter of minutes.
I’m going to assume you know the basics or that you can find them in a tutorial or an online reference. When you’re busy trying to make something, you don’t have spare time to read through introductory material. So if you’re still in the beginning stages of learning Rails, be sure to have a copy of Agile Web Development with Rails [RTH11] and a bookmark to the Rails API docu- mentation handy.1
