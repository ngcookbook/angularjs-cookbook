## Who's it for?

---------------

Rails Recipes is for people who understand Rails and now want to see how an experienced Rails developer would attack specific problems. Like with a real recipe book, you should be able to flip through the table of contents, find something you need to get done, and get from start to finish in a matter of minutes.
I’m going to assume you know the basics or that you can find them in a tutorial or an online reference. When you’re busy trying to make something, you don’t have spare time to read through introductory material. So if you’re still in the beginning stages of learning Rails, be sure to have a copy of Agile Web Development with Rails [RTH11] and a bookmark to the Rails API docu- mentation handy.1









The book contains 80 proven recipes to ease your development with AngularJS.


Why you might consider buying it?

You want to learn new tricks. You may have realized that documentation doesn’t contain all necessary info or you may know one function description but don’t know yet how to use them.
You've may have already done this before but there are always those pesky tricky parts of a code that consumes a lot of your time. You want to avoid wasting your time with those again, which is what you’re wanting this book to do for you.
You want to learn more about Angular. Some recipes are short and only a rewrite of the documentation with the ‘why’. You could use / learn it from the documentation. But this is not only ‘how’, but ‘where’ and ‘why’. These are usually things which we were asked over and over again.
You are looking for solutions you can trust. All code examples are as brief / minimalistic as they could be. Usually, it sells to have a nice interface. But if you’re looking for a solution, you would want to first figure out what solves your problem and differentiate that from what is just there for stylistic purposes.
If you are reading this book because of those reasons, then you have made the right move. AngularJS Cookbook with give you solutions that work to save you time and effort, it will give you some new recipes that you wwould find very useful and, overall, it will make your life easier.
