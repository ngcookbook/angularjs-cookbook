## Is this book for you

If you’re reading this book, I would assume that it would be because of one of the following reasons:

* You want to learn new tricks. You may have realized that documentation doesn’t contain all necessary info or you may know one function description but don’t know yet how to use them.
* You've may have already done this before but there are always those pesky tricky parts of a code that consumes a lot of your time. You want to avoid wasting your time with those again, which is what you’re wanting this book to do for you.
* You want to learn more about Angular. Some recipes are short and only a rewrite of the documentation with the ‘why’. You could use / learn it from the documentation. But this is not only ‘how’, but ‘where’ and ‘why’. These are usually things which we were asked over and over again.
* You are looking for solutions you can trust. All code examples are as brief / minimalistic as they could be. Usually, it sells to have a nice interface. But if you’re looking for a solution, you would want to first figure out what solves your problem and differentiate that from what is just there for stylistic purposes.

If you are reading this book because of those reasons, then you have made the right move. Angular JS Cookbook with give you solutions that work to save you time and effort, it will give you some new recipes that you wwould find very useful and, overall, it will make your life easier.

What Makes a Good Recipe Book?

If I were to buy a real recipe book—you know, a book about cooking food—I wouldn’t be looking for a book that tells me how to dice vegetables or how to use a skillet. I can find that kind of information in an overview about cooking.
A recipe book is about how to make food you might not be able to easily figure out how to make on your own. It’s about skipping the trial and error and jumping straight to a solution that works. Sometimes it’s even about making food you never imagined you could make.
If you want to learn how to make great Indian food, you buy a recipe book by a great Indian chef and follow his or her directions. You’re not buying just any old solution. You’re buying a solution you can trust to be good. That’s why famous chefs sell lots and lots of books. People want to make food that tastes good, and these chefs know how to make (and teach you how to make) food that tastes good.
Good recipe books do teach you techniques. Sometimes they even teach you about new tools. But they teach these skills within the context of and with the end goal of making something—not just to teach them.
My goal for Rails Recipes is to teach you how to make great stuff with Rails and to do it right on your first try. These recipes and the techniques herein are extractions from my own work and from the “great chefs” of Rails: the Rails core developer team, the leading trainers and authors, and the earliest of early adopters.
I also hope to show you not only how to do things but to explain why they work the way they do. After reading through the recipes, you should walk away with a new level of Rails understanding to go with a huge list of success- fully implemented hot new application features.
