# Introduction

# About the author


# What makes a good recipe book


Brevity / Minimalism. I assume the if you read this book it's because of one of the following reasons:

* Learn new tricks:
  * documentation means nothing
  * one function description but not how to use them

* Snippets
  * You've done it before. But some code has always a tricky part which consumes a lot of time. You don't want to
  invest it again.

* Learn more about Angular
  * Some recipes are short and are in the documentation. You could use / learn it from the documentation. But a lot
  of people don't use these things. They're things ask over and over.
